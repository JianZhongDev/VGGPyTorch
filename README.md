# VGGPyTorch
A comprehensive tutorial on how to implement and train a VGG model using PyTorch

## Demo notebooks
1. Before training the VGG model, please first use the [VGG_Preprocessing.ipynb](./VGG_Preprocessing.ipynb) notebook to calculate the channel average value, and channel PCA eigenvectors and eigenvalues on the training dataset, which is required by the data processing and augmentation during training. Copy the results to the traininng notebooks ([VGG_Train.ipynb](./VGG_Train.ipynb) and [VGG_Train_w_PreTrainModel.ipynb](./VGG_Train_w_PreTrainModel.ipynb)).
2. To train shallow models, please use the [VGG_Train.ipynb](./VGG_Train.ipynb) notebook.
3. To train deep models, which requires transfering learned paremeters from pretrained models, please start with  the [VGG_Train.ipynb](./VGG_Train.ipynb) notebook and then use[VGG_Train_w_PreTrainModel.ipynb](./VGG_Train_w_PreTrainModel.ipynb) to transfer learned parameters from pretrained models and perform training.
